What is the match between this popular drink and the animal? And way we are putting those
things into the GIS field?
Because the word "beer" and the word "deer" sounds similar and this becomes a problem for
people with a reading disorder. 
That is our story because we tryed to mitigate those kind of problems while using Open
Street Map and for now on any GIS software

Dyslexia is the most widespread specific learning difference in Europe 
We have direct experience with dyslexics and we brought togheter solutions that worked
and continue to work in our every day activities:

 - uppercase letters and specific fonts to increare readability
 - Spacing in page is important, dislexics read single words in isolation
 - and specific software that helps dyslexics the hear the correct sound of the words

First we removed the ninty percent of geographical information keeping only some layers: 
restaurants, roads, museums, schools, supermartket, and few others.
and after that we started adding specific functionalities:

 - location history, to hel the user to recognize the path followed to reak the location
 - eagle eye in a tap and quick return exaclty to the same position
 - every 5 seconds we run automatically an identify to prevent the user to feel lost
 - the identification can be done on any point of the map, regardeless of the layer
 - and last but not the least the text2speech capability in case of panic

The innovation in our project is in 3 places:

 - For the first time a GIS application has been developed specifically for a dyslexic 
   user for now we have few feedback (from our testers only) but they found our application 
   far more usable than the general purpose ones.
 - From the technology point of view we implemented the identification process totally 
   client side. We invented and make use of this brand new techonology embedding feature ids into the
   tiles where the feature is.
 - And a consequence of this technology is that every static web server can host a 
   complete GIS application. No need to have Geoserver, mapserver, databases to Host.
   You need them to produce the data and the tiles.

As OSM for the dyslexic team now we know how to map for a dyslexic user and we can say 
that we have experience into the field.

 - uppercase letters
 - use of specific fonts
 - straight words surrounded by enough empty space to prevent crowding
 - help the user with specific functionalities
